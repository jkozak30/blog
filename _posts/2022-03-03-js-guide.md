This article aims to provide a basic guide to JavaScript's functionality and syntax.

#### JavaScript
JavaScript is an object-oriented language that is used to create more complex functionalities for websites, such as including graphics/animations and interactive elements. It differs from languages like Python and Java in that it is prototype-based, as opposed to class-based. 

#### Variables and Functions
Here are some functionalities common to many languages, in one code block:

``` javascript
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // DECLARING VARIABLES/OBJECTS
    var x = 10; //vars are declared globally and can be changed 
    // globally.
    const y = "hello"; //const is declared locally and is static.
    let z = {}; //let declares locally and can be changed locally.
    let w = true;
    var q = function(){}; // more on this below

// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // ARRAYS
    // Arrays in JavaScript are most similar to those in Python.
    var x = {}; //initializes empty array
    x.push("hello"); //String "hello" is added to the end of 
    // the array
    x.push("world");
    x.push(7); //multiple object types can exist in one array
    console.log(x[1]); //object at index 1 (7) is printed in 
    // console
    x.pop(); //last element (7) is removed
    x.shift(); //first element ("hello") is removed
    x[0] = "hello"; //resets value of object 0
    x[1] = "world"; //same as push

// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // LOOPS
    // Loops are pretty much the same as they are in other 
    // languages, here are some examples that all do the 
    // same thing, count from 10 and liftoff:

    // While
    var i = 10;
    while (i > 0) {
        console.log(i);
        i--;
    }
    console.log("liftoff!");

    // Do while: like while, but checks if condition is true after 
    // the given function was performed
    let i=10;
    do {
        console.log(i);
        i--;
    } while (i > 0)
    console.log("liftoff!");

    // For: initializes variable that only exists within the loop
    for (var i=10; i>0; i--) {
        console.log(i);
    } console.log("liftoff!");

// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // IF ELSE/CONDITIONALS
    // Pretty much the same as everywhere else, here's an example
    // of else if:

    let win = false;
    let points = 0;
    if (points > 10) {
        win = true;
    } else {
        win = false;
    }

    // Here are some common comparison operators within conditional:
    let a = 0;
    let b = 0;
    let c = true;
    let d = false;
    if (a == b) { /* happens */ }
    if (a > b) { /* doesn't happen */ }
    if (a < b) { /* doesn't happen */ }
    if (c && d) { /* AND: doesn't happen */ }
    if (c || d) { /* OR: happens */ }
    if (!c) { /* NOT: doesn't happen */ }

// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    // FUNCTIONS
    // functions do things.
    // they can exist as objects such as in the first section, and 
    // they usually do so within an object.
    // here are some examples:

    var printDOTW = function() {
        var d = new Date(); // this holds a string of the date
        // detour: it's also pretty useful and comes with methods
        // like getDay(), getMonth(), getFullYear()
        var DOTW = d.getDay(); //0-6 digit of the day of the week
        console.log(DOTW);
    };

    // they can also return values (without special declaration)
    var DOTW = function() {
        var d = new Date(); // this holds a string of the date
        // detour: it's also pretty useful and comes with methods
        // like getDay(), getMonth(), getFullYear()
        var DOTW = d.getDay(); //0-6 digit of the day of the week
        return DOTW;
    };

    // they can take parameters
    var newAccount(username, password) {
        this.username = username;
        this.password = password;
    } // the variables called 'username' and 'password' within 
    // the object that contains this function will be set to 
    // the values of the parameters.

    // 'function' is also used to declare an object
    function Ball(x, y, radius) {
        this.x = x; // this.x instantiates a variable called x
        this.y = y;
        this.radius = radius;

        var roll = function(dist) {
            this.x += dist;
        }
    }

```


#### JavaScript in HTML
You can include on page JavaScript via a ```<script>``` tag in the head or body of your HTML, or with a separate file containing your script:
``` html
    <!-- EXAMPLE 1: on page -->
    <script type="text/javascript">
        console.log('Hello World');
    </script>

    <!-- EXAMPLE 2: script.js file contains your code -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
```

Here are some HTML functionalities you can use within JavaScript, within one HTML file:
``` html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en" dir="ltr">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>innerHTML demo</h1>
        <p id="q"></p>

        <script> 
            function displayText(){
                document.getElementById("q").innerHTML = "this is your displayed text";
            }
        </script>
    </body>
    </html>
```
