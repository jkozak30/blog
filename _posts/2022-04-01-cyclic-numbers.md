#### Decimals and Modular Arithmetic

Let's say we wanted to write $$0.\overline{315}$$ as a fraction.

Converting a repeating decimal to its fractional form usually follows the following process:
- Set $$x$$ to equal your repeating decimal.
- If $$x$$ is of length $$n$$ digits, consider $$x * 10^n$$.
- Subtracting $$x$$ from this cancels your repeating decimal and produces a finite integral expression equal to $$(10^n - 1)x$$. So, solve for $$x$$.

So, for $$0.\overline{315}$$, we do the following:
- $$x = 0.\overline{315}$$
- $$1000x = 315.\overline{315}$$
- $$999x = 315$$
- $$x = \frac{35}{111}$$

It's then known that every repeating decimal can be written as a rational number. And from this process, we see that all rationals are of the form $$$$

#### $$\mathbb{1/7}$$

The decimal expansion of $$\frac{1}{7} = 0.\overline{142857}$$ has an interesting property.
